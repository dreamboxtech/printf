This project is a joint work by Olaleye Moses Abiola and Oilver-Ugwi Chinedum, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme Cohort 8, 2022.
The project requires that a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. 
It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
